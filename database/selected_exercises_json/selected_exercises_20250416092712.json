It's a compound movement, highly effective for building muscle and strength, aligning with the beginner's goal of defined quads. The user's short time constraint is addressed by its efficiency in targeting multiple muscle parts simultaneously.  The 'beginners' wiki recommends prioritizing compound movements like squats for early skill development and maximizing efficiency."

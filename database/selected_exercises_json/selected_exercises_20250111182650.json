            "selection_reason": "The Wide Grip Lat Pull Down is selected to increase the width of the back, specifically targeting the lats and mid traps. Its wide grip emphasizes the lats, aligning with the user's goal to increase back width. The exercise is suitable for an early intermediate level, providing a good balance of stretch and tension, and allows for progressive overload."

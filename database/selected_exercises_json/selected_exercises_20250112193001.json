            "alternative_equipment": "Resistance bands",
            "tier_reasons": "Offers a big stretch on your lats, provides smooth even tension throughout the range of motion, feels great, and allows for easy overload by increasing the pin weight.",

It targets the lats effectively, which is crucial for achieving the user's goal of increasing back width. The exercise is also stable and allows for easy progression, making it suitable for someone with less than 3 months of experience."

            "selection_reason": "The Neutral Grip Lat Pull Down is selected for its emphasis on the lats, which aligns with the user's goal of increasing back width. The neutral grip provides a slightly different angle of pull, which can help in engaging the lats more effectively. This exercise is also beginner-friendly and allows for controlled progression."

It provides a high stretch and tension, which is beneficial for muscle growth. The unilateral nature of the exercise also makes it suitable for beginners to focus on form and muscle engagement."

                "Pectoralis Major": "Responsible for movements of the shoulder joint, including flexion, adduction, and internal rotation."
            },
            {
                "Upper Pectorals": "Emphasized in incline movements, contributing to shoulder flexion and horizontal adduction."
            },
            {
                "Mid Pectorals": "Targeted in flat bench movements, involved in horizontal adduction and shoulder flexion."
            },
            {
                "Lower Pectorals": "Engaged in decline movements, assisting in shoulder extension and adduction."
            }
        ],
        "form_details": "For exercises like the bench press, ensure the barbell touches the chest for full range of motion. Incline and decline angles adjust emphasis on different pectoral regions. Dumbbell presses allow for a deeper stretch as they can move past the rib cage. Machine presses provide stability and a consistent path, enhancing mind-muscle connection. For fly variations, cables offer smooth tension, while dumbbells lack tension at the top of the movement.",
        "training_keys": "To effectively train the chest, incorporate a mix of compound and isolation exercises. Compound movements like bench presses and dips provide overall chest development, while fly variations isolate the pecs. Emphasize exercises that offer a deep stretch and allow for progressive overload. Adjust angles to target specific pectoral regions, such as incline for upper pecs.",
        "research_insights": "A recent study found that the incline bench press promotes similar mid and lower pec growth as the flat bench, with additional upper pec benefits. The importance of muscle stretch over contraction for growth is highlighted, suggesting exercises that maximize stretch are more effective.",
        "optimization_notes": "To progress, focus on exercises that allow for easy overload, like machine presses and dips. For advanced lifters, consider using weight belts for dips or heavier dumbbells for presses. Ensure exercises feel comfortable and adjust form or equipment if necessary to prevent injury. Incorporate a variety of angles and equipment to fully develop the chest."

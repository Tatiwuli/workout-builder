        "form_details": "For exercises like the bench press, ensure the barbell is brought down to the chest for maximum tension. Incline variations emphasize the upper pecs, while decline variations target the mid and lower pecs. Dumbbell presses allow for a deeper stretch as they can move past the rib cage. Machine presses provide stability and a consistent range of motion, enhancing the mind-muscle connection. Dips should be performed with a focus on a deep stretch, and push-ups can be modified with bands or deficits for increased tension.",
        "warmup": "Not specifically mentioned in the video.",
        "research_insights": "A recent study found that the incline bench press caused similar lower and mid pec growth as the flat bench, with better upper pec growth. The importance of a deep stretch over contraction for muscle growth is highlighted, suggesting exercises that maximize stretch may be more beneficial.",
        "optimization_notes": "To progress, focus on exercises that allow for easy overload, such as machine presses and dumbbell variations. For advanced lifters, consider using a weight belt for dips or increasing the range of motion in push-ups. Ensure exercises feel good and do not cause pain, adjusting form or exercise selection as needed. Consider incorporating a variety of angles and equipment to target different parts of the chest effectively."

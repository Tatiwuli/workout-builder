        "form_details": "For lateral raises, leaning against a bench can modify the resistance curve to place more tension on the side delts when stretched. Using cables at hand height provides maximum tension on the side delts when stretched. For overhead presses, seated variations offer more stability, and using dumbbells allows for a greater range of motion and more side delt involvement.",
        "training_keys": "Focus on exercises that provide high tension in the stretched position for optimal hypertrophy. For side delts, prioritize exercises like cable lateral raises and behind-the-back cuffed lateral raises. For front delts, machine shoulder presses are recommended. Rear delts benefit from reverse cable crossovers and reverse pec deck exercises.",
        "research_insights": "The video mentions that the trend in current evidence suggests the stretch is more important than the squeeze for muscle growth, although there is little direct evidence on shoulders. Real-world examples show bodybuilders achieving significant growth with exercises like dumbbell lateral raises despite suboptimal tension curves.",
        "optimization_notes": "To optimize shoulder workouts, incorporate exercises that target each deltoid head effectively. Use machines or cables for consistent tension and stability. Consider using wrist cuffs for cable exercises to enhance focus on the delts. Avoid redundant exercises like front raises if pressing movements are already included in the program."

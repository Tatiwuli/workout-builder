            "Runs down the middle, adding shape to the arm.",
            "Long head",
            "Beefs up the triceps from the rear and performs shoulder extension."
        ],
        "form_details": "Press downs can be done using a rope, bar, or reverse grip. The rope allows for a harder contraction by driving handles apart but is less stable. The bar provides more stability and even tension. Overhead cable extensions put the long head under a bigger stretch. Skull crushers should arc the bar back behind the head for better tension. JM press is a hybrid between a close grip bench press and a skull crusher. Kickbacks should focus on a strong contraction with the arm held back.",
        "warmup": "Not provided.",
        "research_insights": "A 2023 study found that overhead extensions caused about 40% more triceps growth than press downs, highlighting the importance of stretching the long head for muscle growth.",
        "optimization_notes": "For optimal triceps development, include exercises that target the long head in a stretched position, such as overhead extensions. Use a variety of shoulder angles to ensure proportional development. Consider exercises like cable kickbacks for a full squeeze of the long head. Progress by adding weight or reps weekly."

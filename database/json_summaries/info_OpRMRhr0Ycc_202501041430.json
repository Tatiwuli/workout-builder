        ],
        "criterias": [
            "High Tension in Stretched Position",
            "The exercise should provide significant tension, especially when the muscle is stretched, to promote growth.",
            "Feels Good",
            "The exercise should not cause pain and should have a smooth resistance profile.",
            "Simple Progression",
            "The exercise should allow for easy progression by adding weight or reps over time."

            {
                "Lateral Head": "Gives the triceps a rounded shape."
            },
            {
                "Medial Head": "Runs down the middle, adding shape to the arm."
            },
            {
                "Long Head": "Beefs up the triceps from the rear and is involved in shoulder extension."
            }
        ],
        "form_details": "For press downs, using a rope allows for driving handles apart at the bottom, enhancing mind-muscle connection but reducing load capacity. A bar provides more stability and allows for more reps. Overhead extensions stretch the long head more effectively. Skull crushers should arc the bar behind the head for better tension. Kickbacks should focus on arm position for peak contraction.",
        "training_keys": "To train the triceps effectively, include exercises that target different shoulder angles. Overhead movements like cable extensions are crucial for stretching the long head. Pressing exercises are good for medial and lateral heads but not sufficient alone. Isolation exercises are necessary for maximum growth.",
        "research_insights": "A 2023 study found that overhead extensions resulted in about 40% more triceps growth compared to press downs, highlighting the importance of stretching the long head for muscle growth.",
        "optimization_notes": "For progression, focus on exercises that allow for easy overload, like the close grip bench press. Use a variety of exercises to target all heads of the triceps. Consider individual arm exercises to address imbalances. Overhead cable tricep extensions are recommended as the best exercise for overall triceps development."

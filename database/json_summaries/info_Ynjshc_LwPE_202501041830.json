        },
        "form_details": "For targeting the gluteus medius, internally rotating the toes is more effective, while externally rotating the toes targets the gluteus maximus. The hip thrust is highlighted as a key exercise for the glutes, with variations like barbell, American, and banded hip thrusts offering different activation benefits. A neutral pelvic position is recommended during hip thrusts for optimal glute activation.",
        "strategies": "Incorporate pre-activation movements to enhance glute recruitment during compound exercises. Use a higher rep scheme for the gluteus medius due to its slow-twitch fiber dominance. Include unilateral exercises with stabilization components to target the gluteus medius. Train glutes 3-4 times per week, considering recovery times for different exercise types: stretcher exercises need 3-4 days, activators need 2-3 days, and pumper exercises need 1-2 days.",
        "research_insights": "A 2014 study by Lien et al. found that internally rotating the toes enhances gluteus medius activation. A 2016 study by Fisher et al. showed that targeted glute training improves recruitment during compound exercises. Contreras et al. (2016) found that barbell hip thrusts result in the greatest upper glute activity. A 2013 study indicated that 30 degrees of hip abduction increases glute activation during prone hip extension.",
        "optimization_notes": "Periodize training by varying routines every 1-3 months to prevent overtraining and ensure strength progression. Focus on increasing weight over time. Consider deloading when signs of overtraining appear, reducing frequency, volume, and load for recovery. Aim for strength progression over the year to ensure continuous improvement in glute development."

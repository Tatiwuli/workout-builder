        "form_details": "For the Smith machine front foot elevated lunge, place most weight on the front foot, with the back foot for balance. Descend slowly, pause at the bottom, and rise. In sumo deficit deadlifts, use a wider than shoulder-width stance with toes pointed out, keeping the back flat and arms straight. For Romanian deadlifts, maintain a flat back, push hips back, and keep knees slightly bent. Squats require chest up, knees forward, and a pause at the bottom.",
        "strategies": "Perform one leg at a time for lunges, resting 15-30 seconds between legs to manage systemic fatigue. Use Versa grips or straps for deadlifts if grip is an issue. Emphasize slow, controlled movements to maximize hypertrophy. For squats, perform as many reps as possible, then continue with bodyweight squats until failure.",
        "research_insights": "The video emphasizes the importance of slow, controlled movements for hypertrophy, aligning with research that suggests time under tension is crucial for muscle growth. No specific studies are cited, but the approach is consistent with general hypertrophy principles.",
        "optimization_notes": "To progress, focus on increasing the weight gradually while maintaining form. Incorporate pauses and slow descents to enhance muscle activation. Ensure adequate rest between sets to manage fatigue and allow for maximum effort in each set."

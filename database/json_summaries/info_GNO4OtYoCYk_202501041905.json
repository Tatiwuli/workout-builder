        "research_insights": "Recent studies suggest that high tension in a stretched position is more important than the total stretch for muscle growth. Preacher curls have been shown to cause more distal biceps growth due to high tension in a stretched position. Incline curls, while providing a big stretch, offer less tension and are less effective.",
        "optimization_notes": "To optimize biceps growth, include exercises like face-away cable curls and preacher curls in your routine. Consider using a mix of strict and cheat curls to maximize load and control during the negative phase. Hammer curls can enhance the biceps peak by targeting the brachialis."

            "The exercise should provide a significant stretch and maintain high tension on the target muscle group.",
            "Feels Good",
            "The exercise should not cause pain, should have a smooth resistance profile, and should facilitate a good mind-muscle connection.",
            "Simple Progression",
            "The exercise should allow for easy progression by adding weight or reps over time."

            {
                "Lats": "Responsible for shoulder adduction, extension, and internal rotation."
            },
            {
                "Midback": "Includes muscles like the rhomboids and traps, responsible for scapular retraction and stabilization."
            },
            {
                "Traps": "Involved in scapular elevation, retraction, and depression."
            },
            {
                "Spinal Erectors": "Support the spine and maintain posture."
            }
        ],
        "form_details": "Wide grip pull-ups and pull-downs emphasize the lats and mid traps. Neutral grip pull-ups shift more emphasis to the lats. Chin-ups involve more bicep engagement. Barbell rows require stabilization from calves, glutes, and lower back. Chest-supported rows allow focus on the back without stabilization issues. Cable rows provide a deep lat stretch, especially when leaning forward on the negative. Face pulls can be modified to improve stability by performing them seated or lying down.",
        "training_keys": "For optimal back training, focus on exercises that provide a deep stretch and high tension, such as wide grip pull-downs and chest-supported rows. Ensure exercises feel good and allow for progression. Use a variety of grips and angles to target different parts of the back. Incorporate both compound movements for overall back development and isolation exercises like cable lat pullovers for specific muscle engagement.",
        "research_insights": "The video emphasizes the importance of exercises that provide a significant stretch and maintain high tension for muscle growth. It suggests that exercises like the deadlift, while great for overall strength, may not be optimal for back hypertrophy due to limited range of motion for the lats and traps. The video also highlights the benefits of exercises that allow for easy progression and a strong mind-muscle connection.",
        "optimization_notes": "To optimize back workouts, focus on exercises that allow for a deep stretch and high tension, such as chest-supported rows and cable rows. Ensure exercises feel good and allow for progression by adding weight or reps. Modify exercises like face pulls to improve stability and maximize tension on the back. Use a variety of grips and angles to target different parts of the back effectively."

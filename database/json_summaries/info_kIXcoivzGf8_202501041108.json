        "form_details": "For exercises like the barbell back squat, ensure a proper bar path and maintain a stable posture. In front squats, use a grip that feels comfortable, such as the two-finger grip, crossed arm grip, or strap grip, and focus on keeping elbows up. In low bar squats, the barbell is placed on the rear delts, shifting some tension to the glutes. For Smith machine squats, the movement pattern is similar to free weight squats but with reduced stabilizer involvement. In leg extensions, setting the seat back can increase rectus femoris engagement.",
        "training_keys": "To effectively train the quadriceps, include exercises that provide high tension in the stretched position, such as squats and leg presses. Incorporate a variety of squat types to target different aspects of the quads. Ensure exercises feel comfortable and do not cause knee pain. Use progressive overload techniques to enhance muscle growth. Include exercises like leg extensions to fully engage the rectus femoris.",
        "research_insights": "Research indicates that free weights and machines can build muscle equally well if sets are pushed hard. Studies show solid rectus femoris growth with squats, despite anatomical concerns. A new study found more overall quad growth with the seat back leg extension position, likely due to increased rectus femoris stretch.",
        "optimization_notes": "To optimize quad workouts, focus on exercises that allow for deep stretches, such as hack squats and pendulum squats. Use variations like the Smith machine squat to safely push quads to failure. For exercises like the hack squat, use yoga blocks to achieve full depth if necessary. Balance exercises that target all four heads of the quadriceps for comprehensive development."

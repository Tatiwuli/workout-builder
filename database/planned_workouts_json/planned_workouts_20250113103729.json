The Overhead Cable Triceps Extension and Skull Crushers are chosen for their effectiveness in stretching the long head, which is crucial for achieving the user's goal of thicker triceps. The Bar Press Down complements these by targeting the medial and lateral heads. The volume and rest periods are tailored to the user's beginner status, ensuring they can perform the exercises with proper form and recover adequately between sets. The total workout time is 24 minutes, allowing for a brief warm-up or cool-down within the 30-minute session."

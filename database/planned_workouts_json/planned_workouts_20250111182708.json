The exercises are selected based on their effectiveness in targeting the desired muscle groups and parts. The volume and set strategies are designed to fit within the user's 60-minute time constraint while ensuring sufficient stimulus for muscle growth. The use of 3 sets per exercise with 8-12 reps aligns with the early intermediate level guidelines, providing a balance of volume and intensity. The exercises are ordered to alternate between back and biceps, allowing for adequate recovery between sets and optimizing performance. The inclusion of alternative exercises ensures flexibility in case of equipment availability or preference."

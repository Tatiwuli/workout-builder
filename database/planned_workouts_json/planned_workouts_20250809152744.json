The workout duration is kept under 45 minutes by selecting efficient exercises and avoiding unnecessary rest periods.  The exercise order is designed to maximize energy efficiency, starting with larger muscle groups and progressing to smaller ones.  The workout structure aligns with the principles outlined in the provided wikis, emphasizing compound movements, progressive overload, and appropriate rest periods for hypertrophy."

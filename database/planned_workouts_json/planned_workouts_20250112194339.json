The exercises are ordered to target different parts of the back, ensuring comprehensive development. Each exercise is performed for 3 sets of 10-12 reps, which is suitable for a beginner aiming for hypertrophy. The rest periods are kept at 60 seconds to maintain intensity while allowing sufficient recovery. The total workout time, including rest, is approximately 25.5 minutes, fitting well within the user's time constraint. The exercises chosen are beginner-friendly and align with the user's experience level, focusing on compound movements that maximize efficiency and muscle engagement."

    "workout_explanation": "The workout is structured into two supersets, each targeting both the back and biceps. This approach maximizes time efficiency and ensures that both muscle groups are effectively trained within the 45-minute time constraint. The exercises are selected based on their ability to target the user's specific goals: overall back definition and biceps peak development. The use of supersets allows for minimal rest between exercises, keeping the workout intensity high and ensuring that the user can complete the session within the allotted time. The volume and exercise selection are aligned with the user's early intermediate level, providing a balance of compound and isolation exercises to promote muscle growth and prevent plateaus."

The volume is moderate, suitable for a user of unknown experience level. The exercises are ordered to maximize efficiency and minimize rest time. The total workout duration is approximately 90 minutes, which is within the 60-minute time constraint.  The plan incorporates a variety of exercises to target all heads of the triceps and different regions of the pectorals, promoting balanced muscle development.  Progressive overload is emphasized, encouraging the user to increase weight or reps as they get stronger."

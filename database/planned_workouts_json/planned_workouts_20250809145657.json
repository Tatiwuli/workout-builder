The exercise order is designed to maximize efficiency and minimize fatigue. The volume is moderate, suitable for a user of unknown experience level, focusing on proper form and progressive overload. The total workout time is estimated to be under 45 minutes, respecting the user's time constraint. The workout structure aligns with the principles outlined in the provided wikis, emphasizing compound movements, appropriate volume, and rest periods for optimal muscle growth."

It prioritizes compound movements to maximize efficiency and muscle activation within the time limit. The volume is kept relatively low (3-6 sets total per muscle group) to allow for proper form and recovery, aligning with beginner guidelines.  Exercises are ordered to target different muscle heads and regions systematically.  Rest periods are optimized to balance recovery and time efficiency.  Alternative exercises are provided to allow for flexibility and equipment availability. The workout incorporates a variety of exercises to target all three muscle groups effectively, while keeping the total workout time under 45 minutes."

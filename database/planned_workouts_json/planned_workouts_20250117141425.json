The exercises are ordered to target larger muscle groups first, ensuring energy is maximized for compound movements. The volume and set strategies are designed to fit within the 60-minute time constraint, with rest periods optimized for recovery and efficiency. The selection of exercises and their alternatives ensures that the user can maintain variety and progression, aligning with intermediate training principles. The workout plan adheres to the guidelines by incorporating compound and isolation exercises, balancing volume and intensity to achieve the user's fitness goals."

Isolation exercises are included to target specific muscle parts and ensure comprehensive development. The exercise order is designed to allow for progressive fatigue, starting with the largest muscle groups and moving to smaller ones.  The volume and rep ranges are tailored to an advanced user, allowing for higher intensity and volume while remaining within the 45-minute time constraint.  The workout structure aligns with the principles outlined in the provided wikis, emphasizing both compound and isolation exercises, progressive overload, and appropriate rest periods for an advanced user."

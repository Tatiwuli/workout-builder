    "workout_explanation": "The workout session is structured to target the user's goals of rounded glutes and defined quadriceps while also addressing the hamstrings. The exercises are ordered to prioritize compound movements first, which require more energy and engage multiple muscle groups, followed by more targeted exercises. The volume and set strategies are designed to fit within the 60-minute time constraint, with each set including rest times carefully calculated to ensure the entire session remains efficient and effective. The use of compound exercises like the Barbell Back Squat and Romanian Deadlift allows for progressive overload, which is crucial for muscle growth. The inclusion of exercises like the Barbell Hip Thrust and Bulgarian Split Squat ensures that the glutes and quadriceps are effectively targeted, aligning with the user's fitness level and goals."

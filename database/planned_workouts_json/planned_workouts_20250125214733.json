    "workout_explanation": "The workout session is structured to target the user's goals of enhancing biceps peak and overall back definition. The exercises are ordered to first target the back with compound movements, followed by isolation exercises for the biceps. This order ensures that the larger muscle group (back) is trained first, allowing for maximum energy and focus. The volume and set strategies are designed to fit within the 45-minute time constraint, with each set including rest times carefully calculated to ensure the workout is efficient and effective. The selected exercises and their alternatives provide flexibility while maintaining the focus on the user's specific goals."

The exercises are ordered to prioritize compound movements first, which require more energy and engage multiple muscle groups, followed by isolation exercises. The volume and set strategies are designed to meet the user's intermediate fitness level and goals, ensuring that each muscle group receives adequate stimulation for growth. The total workout time is kept under 60 minutes by optimizing rest periods and exercise selection, adhering to the user's time constraint. This plan aligns with the user's goals of rounded glutes and defined quadriceps while ensuring balanced development of the hamstrings."

    "workout_explanation": "The workout session is structured to target the user's goals of bigger biceps and overall back definition. The exercises are ordered to first focus on compound back exercises, which require more energy and engage larger muscle groups, followed by isolation exercises for the biceps. This order ensures that the user can maintain intensity throughout the session. The volume and set strategies are designed to fit within the 60-minute time constraint, with each set including rest times carefully calculated to ensure the workout is efficient and effective. The selected exercises and their alternatives provide a balanced approach to muscle development, leveraging compound and isolation movements to meet the user's goals and experience level."

    "workout_explanation": "The workout session is structured to target the user's specified muscle groups: glutes, quadriceps, and hamstrings. The exercises are ordered to prioritize compound movements first, followed by unilateral and isolation exercises, optimizing energy and muscle engagement. The volume and set strategies are designed to fit within the 60-minute time constraint while ensuring sufficient volume for muscle growth, aligning with the user's intermediate fitness level and goals. The use of compound exercises like the Barbell Back Squat and Romanian Deadlift allows for efficient targeting of multiple muscle groups, while exercises like the Bulgarian Split Squat and Barbell Hip Thrust provide focused engagement on specific muscle parts. The rest times and weight recommendations are tailored to maintain intensity and promote progressive overload, crucial for achieving the user's goals of rounded glutes and defined quadriceps."

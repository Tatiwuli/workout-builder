    "workout_explanation": "The workout session is structured to target the user's goals of lifted glutes, toned hamstrings, and defined quads. The exercises are ordered to start with compound movements like the Barbell Back Squat and Romanian Deadlift, which require more energy and engage multiple muscle groups. This is followed by more isolated exercises like the Barbell Hip Thrust and Glute Ham Raise to focus on specific muscle groups. The volume and set strategies are designed to fit within the user's 60-minute time constraint while ensuring sufficient stimulus for muscle growth. The use of moderate weights and rest periods aligns with the user's early intermediate level, allowing for progressive overload and adaptation."

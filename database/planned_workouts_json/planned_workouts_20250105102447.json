The exercises are ordered to start with compound movements that require more energy and focus, such as the Barbell Back Squat and Barbell Hip Thrust, followed by more targeted exercises like the Romanian Deadlift and Bulgarian Split Squat. The volume and set strategies are designed to fit within the user's intermediate-early fitness level, ensuring adequate stimulus for muscle growth while respecting the 60-minute time constraint. The use of alternative exercises provides flexibility and ensures the workout can be adapted to different equipment availability."

The volume and rep ranges are tailored to an intermediate user's capacity for hypertrophy, adhering to the guidelines from the provided wikis.  The exercise order is designed to optimize energy expenditure, starting with larger muscle groups and progressing to smaller ones. The total workout time, including rest periods, remains within the 45-minute constraint.  The use of both compound and isolation exercises, along with the progressive overload strategy, ensures comprehensive muscle development and prevents plateaus."

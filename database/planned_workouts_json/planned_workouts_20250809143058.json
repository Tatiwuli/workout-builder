    "workout_explanation": "This workout prioritizes compound movements for the chest and shoulders, followed by isolation exercises to target specific muscle groups.  The triceps are trained with exercises that target all three heads. The volume and rep ranges are chosen to be suitable for a user of unknown experience level, starting with manageable weights and repetitions to ensure proper form and prevent injury. The total workout time is approximately 60 minutes, including rest periods. The exercise order is designed to maximize efficiency and minimize fatigue, starting with larger muscle groups and progressing to smaller ones.  The workout structure aligns with the principles outlined in the provided wikis, emphasizing a balance of compound and isolation exercises for optimal muscle growth."

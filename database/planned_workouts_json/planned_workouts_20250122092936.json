    "workout_explanation": "The workout session is structured to meet the user's goals of increasing back width and enhancing biceps peak. The exercises are selected based on their ability to target the specific muscle groups and parts effectively. The volume and set strategies are designed to fit within the 60-minute time constraint, with each set including rest time. The exercises are ordered to first target the back, which is a larger muscle group, followed by the biceps. This order allows for optimal energy use and focus on the user's primary goals. The workout adheres to the guidelines for beginners, emphasizing proper form and progressive overload."

The exercises are selected based on their effectiveness for beginners and their ability to target the desired muscle groups. The volume and set strategies are designed to fit within the 60-minute time constraint while ensuring sufficient stimulus for muscle growth. The order of exercises prioritizes compound movements for the back, followed by isolation work for the biceps, aligning with the user's experience level and goals. The use of moderate weights and rest periods ensures the workout is challenging yet manageable for a beginner, promoting progressive overload and muscle development."

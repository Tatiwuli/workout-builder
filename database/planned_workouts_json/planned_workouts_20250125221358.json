    "workout_explanation": "The workout session is structured to target the user's goals of achieving a peak in the biceps and overall back definition. The exercises are ordered to first target the back muscles with compound movements, followed by isolation exercises for the biceps. This order ensures that the larger muscle group (back) is trained first, allowing for maximum energy and focus. The volume and set strategies are designed to fit within the 45-minute time constraint, with each set including rest times carefully calculated to ensure the workout is efficient and effective. The use of alternative exercises provides flexibility and ensures that the user can adapt the workout to available equipment. The selected exercises and their volumes align with the user's early intermediate experience level, providing a balance of challenge and manageability."

    "workout_explanation": "The workout is structured to fit within a 30-minute time frame, using supersets to maximize efficiency. Each superset targets both the biceps and back, aligning with the user's goal of bigger biceps and overall back development. The exercises are chosen based on their ability to provide high tension in the stretched position, which is crucial for muscle growth. The volume and intensity are appropriate for a beginner, focusing on learning proper form and achieving hypertrophy. The use of alternative exercises ensures flexibility and adaptability to available equipment."

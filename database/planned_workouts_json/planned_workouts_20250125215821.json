    "workout_explanation": "This workout session is structured to meet the user's goals of lifted glutes, toned hamstrings, and defined quads. The exercises are ordered to target each muscle group effectively, starting with compound movements like the Barbell Back Squat and Stiff-Legged Deadlift, which engage multiple muscle groups and require more energy. The session progresses to more isolated exercises like the Glute Ham Raise and Barbell Hip Thrust, allowing for focused muscle activation. The volume and set strategies are designed to fit within the 60-minute time constraint, with each set including rest periods to ensure adequate recovery. The use of alternative exercises provides flexibility and ensures the user can maintain proper form and intensity throughout the session. This plan adheres to the guidelines for a beginner, focusing on technique, progressive overload, and balanced muscle development."

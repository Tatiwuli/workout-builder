    "workout_explanation": "Structure and rationale: This 6-set session focuses solely on the biceps (with supporting back musculature) and follows beginner, mid-duration guidance from the provided wikis: include 2 compound exercises (vertical and horizontal pulls) followed by 1 isolation exercise. Total sets = 6 (Assisted Chin-Up 2 sets + Inverted Row 2 sets + Dumbbell Curl 2 sets), which sits squarely in the beginner recommendation of 3\u20136 sets per muscle group per session. Exercise order (vertical compound \u2192 horizontal compound \u2192 isolation) prioritizes complex, higher-skill, and higher-neural-demand movements while the trainee is freshest, then funnels fatigue into targeted isolation work to maximize hypertrophic stimulus and motor learning. Rest and rep prescriptions follow wiki guidance for beginners in a medium-duration session: compounds ~60s rest, isolation 30\u201360s (here 45s), and rep ranges in the hypertrophy band (6\u201312 for compounds, 8\u201315 for isolation). No advanced strategies (supersets/dropsets) are used because the trainee is a beginner and the time budget (50 minutes) does not require time-saving techniques; the designed per-set durations (sum = 8.84 minutes) are conservative and realistic for completion with quality form and brief transitions. Volume reasoning: the workout provides focused, manageable volume to stimulate hypertrophy while prioritizing technique and progressive overload (reduce assistance or add load over time). The alternatives provided for each exercise give scalable options if equipment or ability dictates substitutions, with clear, actionable weight/assistance-selection guidance to maintain training intensity and progression potential."

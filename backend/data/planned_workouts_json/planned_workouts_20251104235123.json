    "workout_explanation": "No sets were scheduled because the provided exercise list is empty and the user's workout_duration is 0 minutes. The total allowed session time is therefore 0, so it is impossible to assign any sets (each set requires >0 time). According to the provided wikis I would normally: for a short workout and unknown experience level prioritize 1\u20133 exercises per target muscle group; use 3\u20136 total sets per muscle group for beginners or 6\u201310 for early-intermediates; place compound movements first and use antagonist supersets to save time (rest 30\u201360s between supersets); and select rep ranges 6\u201312 for compounds and 8\u201315 for isolations. To produce a full, time-feasible hypertrophy workout that adheres to the wikis and your constraints I need (at minimum) a nonzero workout_duration (minutes), the target muscle group(s), your experience level (beginner/intermediate/advanced), and a list of available exercises or equipment. Provide those and I will return a complete session with per-set durations, strategies, reps, weights guidance, rest times, alternatives, and a final verification that total time fits the duration."
